# Web Scraper Challenge

*Web Scraper Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 11*

## Mars News and Weather Scraping
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Primary Jupyter Notebook (`Section 1 - Mars News Scraping.ipynb`):**
This notebook includes the intial demonstration of web scraping using a site focusing on Mars news article titles and sections. It uses *Python's libraries, Splinter and BS4 (BeautifulSoup)* to scrape through the site and extract the requested data.

* **Secondary Jupyter Notebook (`Section 2 - Mars Weather Analysis`):**
This notebook serves as a web scraper and data analysis tool for a site containing a table covering temperature data on Mars. It uses *Python's libraries, Splinter and BS4 (BeautifulSoup)* to scrape through the site and extract the requested data. It then uses *Pandas* to clean and analyze the data, and *Matplotlib* to visualize the data.

## Files Included
- `Section 1 - Mars News Scraping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook scraping Mars news article titles and sections.
- `Section 2 - Mars Weather Analysis`: Jupyter notebook scraping Mars weather data and analyzing it.
- `Mars Temp Analysis.csv`: CSV file containing the scraped Mars weather data (contained in *Extracts* directory).

All scripts and notebooks were developed in a *Python* environment managed by *Anaconda*, with code written in *Visual Studio Code*.

Teamwork with a few fellow classmates was required for certain sections of this assignment as there was some trouble with web scraping the right parts for this.

Coding Soundtrack for this week's challenge was Slipknot's album, [The End, So Far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxA687tYuMWjguuCvYQCOa399HPx8PM9G).
